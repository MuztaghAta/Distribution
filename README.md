# Distribution
This is a project on data analysis. Given a data set, we are interested in visualizing the data in terms of PDF and CDF, and fitting the curve to known distributions in order to charecterize the data set in a scientific way and to get deep insights from the data.

Here provides a sample dataset about the bitrates of many short videos from Douyin.
